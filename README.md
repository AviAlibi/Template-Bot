Discord bot

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Instructions

1. Install required Python packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Edit `.env` with required variables
3. Run `bot.py`

## Best Practices

1. Always keep requirements updated
2. Keep the .gitignore up to date and make sure the .env NEVER hits github
3. clear the logs or move the file to another folder every so often, that file fills up fast
4. Avoid recoding the same items over and over, if you use it twice, make it a function in cogs\python_commands.py
